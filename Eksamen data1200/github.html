    <h2>Collaborating with GitHub</h2>
    <p>Include four images, two showing part of commits history, and two showing a specific change. See examples
        below. Write a short text (at least 200 words), split in paragraphs with sub-headings about collaboration in
        repositories like GitHub. Include</p>
        <p>• EITHER a short list of benefits of Git, GitHub, OR LiveShare in VS Code;</p>
        <p>• OR a short list of issues you had setting up Git-connection in VS Code, OR using GitHub</p>
        <p>An example of a Commits history. Names redacted. Right: An example of a specific change in a Commit.
        The best collaborative use of Git happens when everyone commits incremental changes, and this is what we
        want documented, if possible. Both examples above indicate frequent and small changes committed to a shared
        repository.

            <h3>Enhancing Teamwork with GitHub</h3>
            <p>GitHub is an massively important tool for collaboration in software development. 
            It allows teams of coders and programmers to work on the same codebase simultaneously while also maintaining version control and tracking changes. 
            By using repositories, teams can divide tasks and assign them to eachother effectively, and monitor progress through commits and pull history on the github desktop app. 
            The platform makes it easier for teams to track down errors in the code, which makes for effective communication and problem-solving. 
            GitHub another great thing about github is that every change is logged with detailed information about who made it and why.</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Git and GitHub</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>collaborate remotely:</strong> GitHub acts as a central hub, allowing us to collaborate seamlessly both when we are togheter and when we work seperately.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Review and Feedback:</strong> Pull requests make it easy to suggest improvements and catch errors before they merge into the main branch.</li>
                <li><strong>Version control:</strong> Git enables coders to track changes, revert to previous versions, and manage code effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Github is Open Source:</strong> Many open-source projects are hosted on GitHub, providing us amateur developers opportunities to browse, learn from and contribute to projects in git.</li>
            </ul>
