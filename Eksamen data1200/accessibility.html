            <h3>Automated Accessibility Testing</h3>
            <p>
                I tested the site using Lighthouse, an automated tool that evaluates various aspects of accessibility, 
                such as contrast, semantic structure, and proper use of attributes. 
                The tools flagged the following strengths and areas for improvement:
            </p>
    
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alt Attributes:</strong> All images included descriptive alt text, ensuring they are accessible 
                    to screen readers. For example, the Audi image uses the alt text: "Audi," which briefly describes the car 
                    for visually impaired users.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> The site's color scheme was tested to be colorblind-friendly, 
                    with high contrast ratios between text and background.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Structure:</strong> Proper HTML5 elements, such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, 
                    <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>, were used for content organization, 
                    aiding assistive technologies in navigating the site.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Areas for Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oversized Images:</strong> Oversized images were identified in the initial design, 
                    leading to inefficiencies in loading. This issue was resolved by implementing responsive images.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h3>Manual Accessibility Checks</h3>
            <p>Automated tools cannot catch everything. We conducted manual checks for the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logical Tab Order:</strong> Navigation via the keyboard was tested to ensure all interactive elements, 
                    such as links and buttons, followed a logical tab order.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Media queries and flexible layouts were used to ensure the site adapts 
                    seamlessly across devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Smaller images were used to reduce bandwidth usage and improve loading speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Hover and Focus States:</strong> Interactive elements, like images, were manually checked to ensure 
                    they provide visual feedback when focused or hovered, enhancing usability for keyboard users.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                While automated tests are a helpful starting point, manual testing revealed nuances that require careful coding 
                decisions to create a fully accessible site. Semantic HTML, responsive design, optimized images, and careful 
                attention to interactivity ensure the site is inclusive for all users.
